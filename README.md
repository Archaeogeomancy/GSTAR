# GSTAR
Code from the Geosemantic Technologies for Archaeological Research doctoral research project developed using Eclipse.

The project uses a Parliament database to persist data used in the project. Due to licensing constraints, this data cannot be shared, sorry.

The webserver used is Glassfish 4.1 but any webserver can be used. Simply configure the Eclipse project to suit.
